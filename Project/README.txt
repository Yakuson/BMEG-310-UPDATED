Project overview:
Our markdown file is roughly composed of the following sections, in order.
Detailed explainations of code blocks can be found in code comments.

1. Library and file set-up
2. Filtering variables and generating a binary matrix (like a pivot table)
3. PCA and clustering, followed by brief visualizations of data
4. Differential expression analysis with RNA seq expression data and first PC from the previous step
5. KEGG pathway analysis
6. Survival analysis and Kaplain Meier plot generation

Results were inconclusive and did not point to the existence of LSCC subtypes within our dataset. 
For further information, please refer to our final report.
